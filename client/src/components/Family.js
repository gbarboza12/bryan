       This is my mom. She has abandoned me twice throughout my life. The first
       time was when she "went to college" in Austin and left me behind with
       my grandparents. After that ordeal, she moved back home with me and we
       lived happily for four years, until she decided to kidnap me and take me
       to Chicago. At first, I was okay with the move because I had just recently
       gotten divorced, and I wanted a fresh start. Eventually I got sick
       of being couped up in an apartment all day while my mom was "at work".
       Moreover, I was unable to sun bathe at my leisure and I was turning pale!
       Luckily my grandparents picked me up and took me back home. I kind
       of miss my mom and running with her in the clearing behind the apartment,
       but I am much happier now and that is all that matters.
